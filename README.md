Simulates a Version of Kalah where you can compete with a human or computer opponent

Kalah is a game where you try to put as many beans into your pot as possible. Choose one of the following holes on your side of the board and it will move that corresponding number of beans counterclockwise around the board. There are certain rules to remember:
1. If you land in your pot on the last bean, you get another turn.
2. If you land on an empty space on your last bean, you take all of the beans on the opposite side of the board.

Whoever has more beans in their pot wins!
